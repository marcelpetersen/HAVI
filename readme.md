HAVA
==================
- What is HAVA?
HAVA will have an alghoritm to put every picture you take during your travel days into an unique album. The album will set the pictures from the first day you leave your home till you come back home. You can easily show it your friends with a simple slideshow. Before you go on to your travel destination make sure you check with the locals and talk with them to ask, what the city is all about, where you can find the best spots. Here you also can see some pictures of the places where you go to. The favourite answers of the city are on the top. 
If you don't know where to go to, you can see some travelplans from other travellers to make sure you'll get surprised with the city your going to. you can copy and paste to make your own travelplan. Travelplans can go from a citytrip till a full roadtrip.
